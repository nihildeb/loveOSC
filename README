loveOSC is a fork of luaOSC(http://luaforge.net/projects/luaosc/) which implements the Open Sound Control Protocol (http://opensoundcontrol.org/) but substitutes the LPACK dependency with VSTRUCT for greater portability


The testproject sends a OSC message to a server on port 57110, which is Supercolliders OSC port. It also receives OSC messages on port 7771.


Features:
- Client, sending/encoding OSC messages/bundles
- Server, receiving/decoding/handle OSC messages

Updates:
12-11-11 Receiving OSC Messages seems to be broken, also since LÃ¶ve 0.8 will probably allow the use of c-modules loveOSC will
no longer be necessary...
